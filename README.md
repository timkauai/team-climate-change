# Customizing the ChillerPlate

## Google Analytics
To customize this MVP boilerplate change the following variables to the correct 
google analytics keys.

`G_TRACKING_ID`

## Text
Change the demo text, titles, and links in all `.html` files.

## Links
Links can look like `href="#"`. turn the `#` into your link, like `href="https://www.google.com"`
## Images
Images can be changed by finding `<img src=""` and putting 
the path of the image file into the `src=""` quotes.

We suggest putting your images in the `./images/` directory
## Customizing Color
If you want to change any colors, find the HTML element and add to the 
class the name of the color you want.

For example, `<nav class="white"` can be changed to `<nav class="purple"` for a purple navbar.

If you want to change the color of text, find the element, and add a class `color-text`

For example, `<nav class="purple white-text"` will have a purple background and a white text.
